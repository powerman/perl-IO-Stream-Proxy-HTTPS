=head1 NAME

IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS - HTTPS proxy plugin for IO::Stream


=head1 VERSION

This document describes IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS version v1.0.5


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::Stream;
    use IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS;

    IO::Stream->new({
        ...
        plugin => [
            ...
            proxy   => IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS->new({
                host    => 'my.proxy.com',
                port    => 3128,
                user    => 'me',
                pass    => 'mypass',
            }),
            ...
        ],
    });


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is plugin for L<IO::Stream> which allow you to route stream
through HTTPS (also called CONNECT) proxy.

You may use several IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS plugins for single IO::Stream
object, effectively creating proxy chain (first proxy plugin will define
last proxy in a chain).

=head2 EVENTS

When using this plugin event RESOLVED will never be delivered to user because
target {host} which user provide to IO::Stream will never be resolved on
user side (it will be resolved by HTTPS proxy).

Event CONNECTED will be generated after HTTPS proxy successfully connects to
target {host} (and not when socket will connect to HTTPS proxy itself).

=head1 INTERFACE 

=over

=item new({ host=>$host, port=>$port })

=item new({ host=>$host, port=>$port, user=>$user, pass=>$pass })

Connect to proxy $host:$port, optionally using basic authorization.

=back


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< {host}+{port} required >>

You must provide both {host} and {port} to IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS->new().

=item C<< {user}+{pass} required >>

You have provided either {user} or {pass} to IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS->new()
while you have to provide either both or none of them.

=item C<< {fh} already connected >>

You have provided {fh} to IO::Stream->new(), but this is not supported by
this plugin. Either don't use this plugin or provide {host}+{port} to
IO::Stream->new() instead.
